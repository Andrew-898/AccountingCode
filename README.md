#AccountingCode
A project for an automated accounting program. This will take inputs from users and turn them into journal entries. It will also use those journal entries to create a Journal Summary with all stored information. 

In order to get the information required to create the jounral entries, a series of inputs will be required. The user will first be prompted to enter the date and a description of the transaction. Then there will be an input for debit information. This will include the account name, followed by the account ballance. Once the first credit is entered there will be an indentation before the account name in the journal entry. Then once all accounts have been entered the user will have a prompt to quit the loop and the program will use that information to print an entry. Then there will be a input for done, "n", or to add another jounral entry, "y". If the user says "n" the program will print the Journal Summary with all previous information, otherwise the user must input more to create another entry. The Jounral Summary will have a list of all of the accounts and their values from each of the journal entries. In the end it will print a vertical list and look neat.
