#AccountingCode
A project for an automated accounting program. This will take inputs from users and turn them into journal entries. It will also use those journal entries to create a general ledger with all stored information. 

In order to get the information required to create the jounral entries, a series of inputs will be required. The user will first be prompted to enter "dr" or cr" to determine whether the first account is a debit or a credit. Then the account name, followed by the account ballance. Once the first credit is entered there will be an indentation before the account name in the journal entry. Then once all accounts have been entered the user will have a prompt to quit the loop and the program will use that information to print an entry. Then there will be a input for done or to add another jounral entry. If the user says done the program will print the general ledger with all previous information, otherwise the user must input more to create another entry.
